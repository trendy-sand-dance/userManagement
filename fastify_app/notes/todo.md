1) make db table an environment variable
2) check each column in database + restrictions, add to registration correctly (name needed but no field to input name)
3) import paths etc, env variables...
9) create some variables for errors/logs like db not inited
	and the main messages for clients like db connection error/http error pages...



**now working on**
6) editing passwords etc
7) deleting accounts/users
11) dashboard needs info from login... after login,  pass user to dashboard for user specific dash
8) registerUser controller is a export async function, good?
	what is this? should the rest be? I need to learn
10) check this: id: result.lastInsertRowid
	i need to check this but i think naturally when a new element is added to the db table, the id increments, so to get that id number we can use something like the above



**later/not/someoneelse**
12) flash messages + key stufff



**team**
1) same page for names of things like database table for users etc
2) lets start collecting env varibales etc so we all use the same
3) do we need/want a name ? or just username, password? email?
