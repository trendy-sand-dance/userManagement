**me**
1) make db table an environment variable
2) check each column in database + restrictions, add to registration correctly (name needed but no field to input name)
3) import paths etc, env variables...
5) dashboard needs info from login...
4) login controller
6) editing passwords etc
7) deleting accounts/users
8) registerUser controller is a export async function, good?
	what is this? should the rest be? I need to learn
9) create some variables for errors/logs like db not inited
	and the main messages for clients like db connection error/http error pages...
10) check this: id: result.lastInsertRowid
	i need to check this but i think naturally when a new element is added to the db table, the id increments, so to get that id number we can use something like the above


**team**
1) same page for names of things like database table for users etc
2) lets start collecting env varibales etc so we all use the same
3) do we need/want a name ? or just username, password? email?
